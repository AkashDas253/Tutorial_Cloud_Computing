## Cloud Fundamentals

### Definition of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the **delivery of computing services**—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—**over the Internet ("the cloud")** to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

* Resources are **on-demand**
* Pay-as-you-go pricing
* Managed by **cloud service providers (CSPs)**

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing

| Characteristic         | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| On-demand self-service | Users can provision computing capabilities without human interaction.     |
| Broad network access   | Services available over the network via standard mechanisms (e.g., HTTP). |
| Resource pooling       | Resources are shared across multiple users using multi-tenancy.           |
| Rapid elasticity       | Resources can be scaled out/in quickly, sometimes automatically.          |
| Measured service       | Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported for transparency.   |

### Traditional IT vs Cloud Computing

| Feature         | Traditional IT                  | Cloud Computing        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Deployment Time | Weeks or months                 | Minutes                |
| Cost Model      | Upfront CAPEX                   | Pay-as-you-go OPEX     |
| Scalability     | Limited; manual upgrade         | Automatic, on-demand   |
| Maintenance     | In-house                        | Vendor-managed         |
| Accessibility   | Physical access or internal VPN | Global internet access |
