### 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

**Definition**: Delivers virtualized computing resources over the internet such as servers, storage, and networking.

| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Responsibility   | User manages OS, applications, data             |
| Provider manages | Hardware, virtualization, networking            |
| Use Case         | Hosting VMs, storage, backup, disaster recovery |
| Examples         | AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs       |

**Key Characteristics**:

* High flexibility and control
* Requires IT expertise
* Charged by compute, storage, bandwidth used

### 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**Definition**: Provides a **platform or runtime environment** to develop, run, and manage applications without managing infrastructure.

| Feature          | Description                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Responsibility   | User manages applications and data           |
| Provider manages | OS, middleware, runtime, servers             |
| Use Case         | Application development and deployment       |
| Examples         | Google App Engine, Azure App Service, Heroku |

**Key Characteristics**:

* Simplifies development lifecycle
* Auto-scaling and patching built-in
* Developers can focus on code

### 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

**Definition**: Provides ready-to-use **software applications** over the internet on a subscription basis.

| Feature        | Description                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| Examples       | Gmail, Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Dropbox |

**Key Characteristics**:

* No installation or maintenance
* Accessible via browser
* Multi-tenant architecture

### 4. Function as a Service (FaaS)

**Definition**: A subset of serverless computing where **developers write functions**, and the cloud provider handles the execution.

| Feature          | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Responsibility   | Developer writes event-driven functions             |
| Provider manages | Infrastructure, scaling, availability               |
| Use Case         | Event processing, microservices, automation         |
| Examples         | AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions |

**Key Characteristics**:

* No need to manage servers
* Executes only when triggered (e.g., API call, event)
* Charges based on number of executions and duration

### 5. Backend as a Service (BaaS)

**Definition**: Provides developers with **ready-to-use backend services** like authentication, databases, and cloud storage.

| Feature          | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Responsibility   | Developer builds frontend and uses backend APIs  |
| Provider manages | Database, authentication, hosting, notifications |
| Use Case         | Mobile/web app development with minimal backend  |
| Examples         | Firebase, AWS Amplify, Parse                     |

**Key Characteristics**:

* Speeds up development
* Scalable backend services
* Focus remains on frontend/UI logic

### 6. Database as a Service (DBaaS)

**Definition**: Offers **cloud-hosted managed database services**, eliminating the need for manual setup and maintenance.

| Feature          | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Responsibility   | Application logic, queries                    |
| Provider manages | Database engine, backup, patching, scaling    |
| Use Case         | Applications needing scalable databases       |
| Examples         | Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Cosmos DB |

**Key Characteristics**:

* Automatic backups and updates
* High availability and fault-tolerance
* Supports SQL/NoSQL databases
