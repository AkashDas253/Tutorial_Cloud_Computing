## Cloud Architecture

Cloud architecture defines the **components and subcomponents** needed for cloud computing, including front-end, back-end, network, virtualization, and orchestration layers. It ensures the **delivery of cloud services** like IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS with **scalability, security, and efficiency**.

| CLI/Console | Command-line tools and web portals for managing resources     |
| Role        | Enables programmatic control and automation of cloud services |

---

### **6. Resource Management**

| Component           | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resource Allocation | Distributes cloud resources like CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth based on demand |
| Autoscaling         | Automatically adjusts the number of resources based on load (vertical/horizontal scaling)    |
| Load Balancing      | Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple resources or servers                    |
| Capacity Planning   | Forecasts future resource needs to avoid under/over provisioning                             |
| Cost Optimization   | Monitors usage patterns and adjusts resources to minimize costs                              |

| Scalability      | Allows cloud services to scale based on the needs of different tenants                       |
| Cost Efficiency  | Shared resources reduce costs for tenants, as they are pooled and managed centrally          |
| Role             | Ensures efficient use of resources while maintaining security and performance across tenants |
